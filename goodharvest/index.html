           <p>Public awareness of the environmental and health benefits of eating more fresh, locally grown fruits and vegetables has been growing fast over the past decade. However, it can be tough to find the time to plan your meals around the foods that are currently in season where you live.</p>

          <p>To get to know my target audience and clarify their needs, I created a user survey to understand what was stopping users from eating more seasonal, local produce — and what might help make this easier.</p>
          <p>I needed to answer the following questions:</p>
          <ul class="bulleted-list">
            <li>What stops people from eating more seasonal, local produce?</li>
            <li>What are the current cooking and shopping behaviors of my target population?</li>
            <li>Do they plan their meals ahead of time, before they shop for food?</li>
            <li>What information might make them want to try a new fruit or vegetable?</li>
            <li>What would they find most helpful in a resource designed to help them discover seasonal, local foods in their area?</li>
            <li>What are the demographics of my target audience?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In total, the survey questions were completed by 38 respondents.

        <p>This survey uncovered a list of user needs that could help shoppers eat more fresh, seasonal foods. These needs include:</p>
        <ul class="bulleted-list">
          <li>A way to easily see which foods are currently in season in the user’s area</li>
          <li>Basic information about produce items, such as basic cooking information, what it tastes like, how to pick a good one, and how long it’s in season in the user’s area</li>

        <p>The survey results also indicated that the <strong>shopping and eating behaviors of my target users were very diverse.</strong> I realized that I needed to build this app with both seasoned foodies and people new to home cooking in mind.</p>

        <p>To better understand the marketplace, I explored the Google Play (Android) and Apple App Store looking for mobile apps that helps users identify local, seasonal produce and discover ways to cook these foods.</p>
        <p>While there are more than a dozen mobile apps created to tackle this problem, the vast majority are poorly designed and offer very little information beyond seasonality. Surprisingly, not one of these competitors integrated an in-app recipe finder with the seasonal produce guide.</p>
        <p>I reviewed the following three competing apps in the Android marketplace:</p>

        <p>Through my competitive analysis, I discovered several features I knew I'd want to include — as well as some problematic elements I could avoid.</p>
        <p>For example, I had initially thought that categorizing foods into fruit and vegetable categories could help users find foods more easily. However, this pattern highlighted an organizational problem within one of the competing apps: <span class="highlight-rose">should tomatoes be categorized as a fruit or a vegetable? What about avocado?</span></p>
        <p>Ultimately, the answer depends on your cultural background and familiarity with plant structure. For this reason, I decided that organizing foods alphabetically with a prominent search bar would be the best strategy.</p>

          <p>Now it was time to imagine the people that would someday use this app. I analyzed my survey data and noticed three general types of users in my pool:</p>
          <ol class="numbered-list">
            <li>Younger working students</li>
            <li>Adults in their 30s and 40s, often with demanding schedules</li>
            <li>Older adults who did the shopping and cooking for the household</li>
          </ol>
          <p>I completed phone interviews with one user from each group, to better understand their unique habits, routines, and needs around grocery shopping and cooking. This also gave me an opportunity to learn why eating more local and seasonal food mattered to these people.</p>
          <p>By better understanding my users’ motivations, I could more effectively design a product that would help them reach their goals.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Information Architecture</h2>
            <p>By this point in my project, I already had a lengthy list of potential user stories. I knew I needed to narrow things down, so I asked myself which would be the most crucial components for helping my three user personas complete two key goals:</p>
            <ol class="numbered-list">
              <li>Discover basic information about a new kind of produce they found at the grocery store or farmers’ market (what it tastes like, how to choose a good one, how long it’s in season, how it’s typically cooked)</li>
              <li>Find a list of recipes  – curated for the users, based on their dietary preferences and cooking skill level – that include that produce item</li>
            </ol>
            <p>While there are a lot of factors at play affecting how much local, seasonal produce a person eats — from cost, to availability, to taste preferences – I had to hone in on just a couple key pieces in my MVP to prevent scope creep.</p>

              <p>From here, I narrowed down my user stories into a short list of the most high priority items. I then converted each of these into detailed user flows.</p>

        <p>I began the wireframing process by researching common design patterns for different screens I knew I would need in my app (onboarding, account creation, recipe detail, etc). From here, I sketched out multiple iterations of each screen using pen and paper.</p>
        <p>When I was happy with my basic sketches, I recreated the best iterations in Figma using simple greyscale shapes and a standard font.</p>

      <section class="content-box content-box-narrow-desktop">
        <p>Once my wireframes were complete, I created a prototype using InVision and completed a quick round of user testing with two users.</p>
        <p>This round of testing helped me discover a small problem with my “user preferences” page during signup: the “none” option under “enter your dietary preferences” was hiding at the bottom of the selection list. The majority of users would likely have no dietary preferences, which meant this button needed to be given greater visibility and precedence in my next iteration.</p>

              <h6 class="centered">Crafting the Brand Identity</h6>
              <p>I kicked off the brand identity process by creating a mood board with inspirational colors, typefaces, and imagery. I then spent some time mind mapping words related to seasons, food, and eating. With some of my early brand name concepts in mind, I began sketching out different logo ideas. Once I had a few that I felt good about, I recreated them in Figma.</p>
              <p>These designs, as well as some brand name concepts, were preference tested a half dozen participants. I ultimately chose the brand name that won the poll (GoodHarvest), however I ultimately disagreed with the popular choice for the logo mark — I wound up choosing the one that I felt was strongest.</p>

              <p>The GoodHarvest logo began with a pen & paper sketch that I photographed, imported into Figma, and traced over using the pen tool. The first digital draft had an organic roughness that I liked, but I realized the rough edges would not scale well.</p>
              <p>To make the logo feel more polished and finished, I rebuilt the logo on a grid using shapes (ellipsis, rectangles, etc) that I then refined with curves. This ultimately gave me a much more “finished” looking logo mark.</p>

              <p>From here, I took these components and developed a complete style guide for the GoodHarvest brand, including logo usage guidelines, typography, a brand story, and a set of guidelines for icons and illustrations.</p>
              <p>Primary Colors in the GoodHarvest palette are fresh, vibrant greens evoking crisp spring asparagus or a creamy avocado.</p>
              <p>Secondary colors should supplement colors from the primary palette and should most often occur in secondary graphic elements such as buttons, backgrounds, and app alerts.</p>

          <h6 class="centered">Part Five</h6>
          <h2 class="section-title">Visual Design & Testing</h2>
          <p>Now that I had the elements needed to create my first complete mockups, I began applying my styles to the wireframes to create a high-fidelity prototype.</p>
          <h4 class="centered">Testing the Preferences Screen<h4>
          <p>While users can enjoy most of the features of GoodHarvest without creating an account, those who do complete this process can see a customized feed of recipes, filtered based on their cooking and dietary preferences. Since this is the key factor driving signups, I knew the preferences screen needed to work very intuitively.</p>
          <p>First, I asked users which active button design they preferred. The version on the right got 100% of the vote, out of 15 voters.</p>
          <div class="grid">
            <div class="justify-center">
              <img src="../images/gh-prefs-1.png" alt="pen sketches of app screens">
              <p class="caption">No votes for this style.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="justify-center">
              <img src="../images/gh-prefs-2.png" alt="pen sketches of app screens">
              <p class="caption">100% preferred this version.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>Next, I asked users which default state they preferred for this question, considering that the majority of users are likely to have no preference. (Option 1 has no buttons selected on default, options 2 & 3 have "none" selected as default.) 67% of voters preferred the version on the far right.</p>
          <div class="grid-three">
            <div class="justify-center">
              <img class="fill" src="../images/gh-prefs-5.png">
              <p class="caption">13% voted for no items selected</p>
            </div>
            <div class="justify-center">
              <img class="fill" src="../images/gh-prefs-6.png">
              <p class="caption">13% voted for no items selected</p>

              <img class="fill" src="../images/gh-prefs-7.png">
              <p class="caption">13% voted for no items selected</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>Based on this feedback, I used the brightest green color for active buttons in this section, and selected the “none” button by default.</p>
          <h4 class="centered">User Testing the Prototype</h4>
          <p>To understand if users could complete the most critical user stories in my prototype, I conducted three usability tests to see if users could complete the following high priority tasks:</p>
          <ol class="numbered-list">
            <li>Signing up for a new account using email</li>
            <li>Find out how to pick a good avocado, and how long they’ll be in season</li>
            <li>Find some recipes that use blueberries</li>
          </ol>
          <p>While all my testers were able to complete these tasks quickly and with ease, there were a number of UI components and organizational elements that testers found confusing.</p>
          <h4 class="centered">Iterations from User Testing</h4>
          <!-- <div class="circle"></div> -->
          <h4>Overhauling the Preferences Page</h4>
          <p>Results from user testing indicated that several elements on this page were confusing. Users noted that “kid-friendly” wasn’t exactly a dietary preference, and the icons in the dietary preferences section made it more difficult to find the information than simple text. One user also pointed out that it was unlikely any user would ever intentionally select a preference for recipes that took a long time to cook.</p>
          <p>To reduce this cognitive overload, I removed the toggle from the food allergies section, converted the food icons into simple text within pills, and removed the confusing cooking time question altogether.</p>
          <div class="grid">
            <div class="justify-center">
              <img class="downsize" src="../images/gh-prefs-v2.png">
              <p class="caption">Version 2</br>Complex preferences page, higher cognitive load</p>

          <div class="justify-center">
            <img class="downsize" src="../images/gh-prefs-v3.png">
            <p class="caption">Version 3</br>Simplified preferences page, lower cognitive load</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h4 class="centered">Breaking Up Content for Better Information Architecture</h4>
        <p>During user testing, multiple users failed to discover the recipes at the bottom of the food detail pages. Finding this important content required a lot of scrolling, which caused users to miss it.</p>
        <p>To solve this problem, I broke up this single long screen into two pages, accessed via tabs at the top for Food Info and Recipes. With this new layout, a shopper who’s making a meal plan before shopping could quickly jump to recipes featuring fresh spring asparagus, for example, rather than having to know that this content is available below the basic food info sections.</p>
        <div class="grid">
          <div class="justify-center">
            <img class="downsize" src="../images/gh-blueberry-v2.png">
            <p class="caption">In version 2, blueberry recipes were hidden below all this content.</p>

            <p class="caption">In version 3, it’s simple to tab between basic food info and recipes featuring that food.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h4 class="centered">Refining the Seasonality Wheel</h4>
        <p>In an app promoting seasonal produce, the “seasonality wheel” on the produce detail page — showing what months a food is in season — is one of the most important features. However, users weren’t clear where the current month sat on the wheel, and were confused as to how to interpret the season icons.</p>
        <p>To solve this problem, month names were added to this design to make this more clear for users.</p>
        <div class="grid">
          <div class="justify-center">
            <img class="fill" src="../images/gh-wheel-v2.png">
            <p class="caption">Users weren’t sure how to tell what months were represented here.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="justify-center">
            <img class="fill" src="../images/gh-wheel-v3.png">
            <p class="caption">Month names were added in version 3, along with a darker title for the current month.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h4 class="centered">Leveraging Established Patterns</h4>
        <p>When faced with the New This Month produce items at the top of the Discover and In Season Now pages, all of my testers intuitively tried to left swipe through the list of items. I had not envisioned this functionality — in fact, I’d designed this as three static items on the Discover page, and a progressive disclosure section on the In Season Now page.</p>
        <p>To better leverage existing UI patterns my users were already familiar with, I added the left swipe functionality to the Discover page. On the In Season Now page, I removed this section completely and added a “view new this month” checkbox to the top of the full list of currently in season produce items to allow the user to filter their results. Since all of the new items would have been duplicated within the list of all foods currently in season, this checkbox filtration method simplifies the page results and removes any instances of duplicative information.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Key Learnings</h2>
        <h4>Stay focused on your most critical user stories.</h4>
        <p>As a food lover who’s worked in the nutrition and public health world for many years, I had endless ideas about how an app could help people improve their health by making it easier to eat more fresh produce. However, I discovered that with passion projects like this, it’s easy for scope creep to set in. Only by focusing on my most critical user stories, was I able to make a distinction between the “must haves” and the “nice to haves.”</p>
        <h4>Watch how your users intuitively interact with a prototype.</h4>
        <p>During the user testing process, I noticed my users trying to interact with different pages of my prototype in a way I hadn’t foreseen — for example, assuming a horizontal list of cards would have left-right scrolling. By paying close attention during testing, I was able to notice which UI elements could be improved upon by leveraging patterns that were already familiar to users.</p>
        <h4>Craft your questions carefully.</h4>
        <p>During the user surveys and testing phases of this project, it became very clear that how I asked questions had a major impact on the quality of my answers. For example, simply asking users which of several designs they preferred doesn’t tell you much. However, giving users the context of your app and asking which of several designs helps them understand the available information better will give you much more valuable information.</p>
