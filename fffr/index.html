     <h2 class="section-title">The Problem</h2>
     <h4>The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented number of Americans experiencing food insecurity.</h4>
     <p>Due to widespread unemployment and economic instability during the coronavirus pandemic, an estimated 1 in 5 U.S. households did not have enough to eat as of April 2020.</p>
     <p>While food banks were overloaded with requests, California farmers were forced to let food rot in the fields, as their primary customers — restaurants — were shuttered during the early days of the pandemic.</p>
     <p>To support both food banks and struggling small farms, a coalition of non-profit organizations and small farms formed the Farm Fresh Food Relief (FFFR) Emergency Food Hub to distribute millions of pounds of unsold fruits and vegetables to the Bay Area's most vulnerable households.</p>
     <p class="no-padding">While the program began with a distribution of 200 hundred boxes per week, a $2.6 million contract from the US Department of Agriculture allowed for a major expansion of the program. By  May, the program had funding to serve 86,000 families in seven counties over a 7-month period.</p>

     <h2 class="section-title">The Solution</h2>
     <h4>Build a resource that works for both project funders and people in need.</h4>
     <p class="no-padding">To increase public awareness of the program, seek additional funding streams, and serve as a  resource for recipients of the free produce boxes, I worked with project leaders to design and develop the program's website, farmfreshfoodrelief.org.</p>
     <p>We knew this needed to be a resource for both box recipients and potential funders, so language and styling had to be appropriate for both groups.</p>
     <p>This site was developed in two phases: the first phase (MVP) involved simple wireframes and minimal branding before development and launch. The second phase involved a much deeper dive into user needs, branding, a style guide, usability testing, new low and hifi mockups, and a significant expansion of site content.</p>
     <p>The first site launch occurred with FFFR's first major press release the first week of June. This PR campaign led to major press exposure as well as a 2.6$ million dollar contract from the US dept of agriculture. As a result, the program grew in capacity to serve 86,000 families in seven counties over a 7-month period.</p>
     <p>By serving as a central information hub for food box recipients, the site also helped save thousands of dollars in printing costs, while giving struggling families high-quality resources for eating healthfully on a limited budget. </p>

     <h2 class="section-title">Phase 1: The MVP</h2>
     <p>Within weeks of the March 2020 shelter-in-place order in the San Francisco Bay Area, the FFFR Emergency Food Hub was distributing their first boxes of locally grown produce to families in need.</p>
     <p>This meant that an initial brand identity, early print marketing materials (for placing inside the food boxes), and a website with basic information about the program needed to be created rapidly to help solicit the first major round of funding.</p>
     <p>The first version was a simple landing page, designed specifically with funders in mind. It was created using basic bootstrap styles, and the language was taken directly from an early funding pitch.</p>
     <p> This no-frills design was launched in just over a week, and the design process consisted of simple wireframes and minimal branding before development and launch.</p>

     <h2 class="section-title" id="pt2-title">Phase 2: Redesigning for Multiple User Types</h2>
     <p>After the MVP was launched, there was time to step back and consider how the website could fully support the program and all of it's potential users.</p>
     <p>I began this phase with a series of meetings with project stakeholders, primarily representatives from the partner organizations and local farms who were participating in the project.</p>
     <p>In these conversations, I asked careful questions to get a strong sense of who this website was for, how this website could help solve communication problems and reduce costs, and when the second version needed to be complete. From here, I created a timeline for myself and jumped into the design process.</p>

     <h4 class="centered tertiary-text">Creating Proto Personas</h4>
     <p>Having worked with food access non-profits for several years, I had a strong intuition for who the stakeholders would be on this project.</p>
     <p>Using this knowledge, I drafted a series of proto-personas to guide the design process, as I knew that there likely wouldn't be time for comprehensive user surveys and interviews.</p>
     <p>The project team leaders helped me brainstorm a list of potential needs and challenges faced by our stakeholders, which helped the group come to alignment on the critical requirements for the second phase of the FFFR site.</p>
     <p>While proto-personas are no replacement for actual quantitative and qualitative data, they can be incredibly useful when time is in short supply.</p>

  <h2 class="section-title" data-aos="fade-up">From Wireframes to Hifi Mockups</h2>
  <div class="content-box content-box-narrow-desktop" data-aos="fade-up">
    <p>In a perfect world, I would have tested the site's functionality with actual  users from the beginning. But the project’s rapid timeline, combined with difficulty finding testers who met the minimum technical requirements of screen sharing in a zoom call (a large percentage of the box recipients had poor internet connectivity and used older devices) led to significant delays in recruiting the first group of testers.</p>
    <p>Shortly after the second version of the site had launched, I finally had an opportunity to complete a series of in-depth interviews and testing with several box recipients. In the following sections, you can see how different parts of the site evolved in response to feedback from user testing and other key stakeholders.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="content-box content-box-narrow-desktop" data-aos="fade-up">
    <h4 class="centered tertiary-text">Improving Legibility</h4>
    <p>Some of the biggest priorities of the collaborative were to highlight the importance of local farms in the Bay Area food system, explain how the program works in a simple way, and use lots of photos to illustrate the many partner organizations involved in the project.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="prototype-grid wireframe-grid" data-aos="fade-up">

    <p class="caption display-desktop paragraph-end">The response to showing the wireframe on the left: photos behind all of these content blocks please!</p>
    <p class="caption" id="test-three-two">However, user testing with actual box recipients showed that site visitors often had a difficult time reading the text overlaying the images.</p>
  </div>
<img class="display-desktop fill py-10"  src="../images/fffr-homepage-final.png" alt="photo collage and color swatches" data-aos="fade-up">

<div class="content-box content-box-narrow-desktop" data-aos="fade-up">
  <p>In the third and final version of the home page, these content blocks were redesigned to lean on a simpler palette of grey tones, with text displaying below the image rather than on top of it.</p>
</div>
<div class="content-box content-box-narrow-desktop" data-aos="fade-up">
  <h4 class="centered tertiary-text">Clarifying the Message</h4>
  <p>User testing indicated that people didn't really understand what the program was about when first landing on the homepage. The best and most succinct explanation for the program was actually buried halfway down the About page, where few users were likely to scroll. So the homepage was redesigned with this copy rewritten for the hero, with a photo of a smiling family holding their FFFR box replacing the generic stock photo of fresh produce.</p>
</div>
<div class="prototype-grid wireframe-grid" data-aos="fade-up">
  <img class="shadow-offset justify-center frame-comp" src="../images/fffr-clarify1.png" alt="greyscale wireframe">
  <p class="caption display-mobile paragraph-end">The landing page doesn’t really explain what the program is — this information is buried in the About Us page.</p>

<div class="content-box content-box-narrow-desktop">
  <h4 data-aos="fade-up" class="centered tertiary-text">Creating Clear Pathways to Content</h4>
  <p data-aos="fade-up">In testing sessions, users tended to completely miss the “resources” and recipes section of the site. When asked to assess the purpose of the site and what they could do there, most testers scrolled around the homepage, clicked on “about the program,” and conclude they had seen everything.</p>
  <p data-aos="fade-up">Google analytics data painted a similar picture, and showed that the vast majority of users would land on the homepage, scroll around for about 1.5 minutes, click to the About Us page, and then leave after another minute or so.</p>

    <h4 class="centered pt-5">Rethinking the Session Builder</h4>
    <p>One of the most complex, yet central functions of the fffr app is the Session Builder. Tutors use this tool to assemble class sessions for individual students or groups made up of learning activities, mastery activities (such as in-class quizzes, where students demonstrate competence), and homework assignments.</p>
    <p>Tutors plan out all of the activities for a specific class session <span class="italic">before</span> the class begins, using it as a road map for instruction.</p>
    <p>After the class session, tutors return to the Session Builder to record how students performed in the mastery activities and to finalize the list of activities that they taught in that session.</p>
    <p>When the Session Preview reflects what happened in the class, the tutor can Publish the session. Only then is a record of the class session, the student's progress, and associated homework assignments or resources made available for the student and parent to see.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="content-box content-box-narrow-desktop" data-aos="fade-up">
    <p>One of the primary issues with this layout is that users can intentionally or unintentionally exit the flow by clicking on any of these navigation elements.</p>
    <p>The session-building progress typically involved 20 or more screens, and I knew we didn’t want users to navigate away from this flow unless they deliberately chose to do so. There are also so many elements on this screen that it’s difficult for the user to understand what they need to do next.</p>

    <p>My new mid-fi mockups included multiple significant changes.</p>
    <p>In this new version of the Session Builder, all high-level navigation elements are hidden, and the next action is marked with arrow buttons in the bottom navigation. With the addition of clear Publish and Save and Exit buttons, users can now save their work and exit the flow whenever they like.</p>
    <p>I also added some simple icons to the class topic hierarchy levels here, as user interviews indicated that people were confused as to how classes, big ideas, and concepts related to one another. The new icons show these as smaller and smaller elements of a whole.</p>
    <p>When I ran this by the education team, which included some seasoned tutors, they asked if the session preview could show more detail about the different class elements, such as the grading status of homework assignments. I incorporated this feedback into the final iteration.</p>

    <p>In the final MVP version of the fffr session builder, the session preview window on the right shows which learning, mastery, and homework activities have been added to an upcoming class session. Each section includes detail about which topics and activities will be covered in each category. Now, tutors can remove activities, or go back and add more at any point in the flow.</p>

      <h4 class="centered">Don't be afraid to start over when necessary.</h4>
      <p>Had I tried to mold the new MVP scope into the designs previously created for the old MVP concept, the product would not be as intuitive, there would be more clicks required to find necessary content, and the structure would be quite different. By letting go of attachments to previous work, I could design a better product.</p>

      <!-- <h4 class="centered pt-5">Consider whether all users need identical or similarly complex elements.</h4> -->
      <!-- <p>The ultimate function of a dashboard is to make things easier for the user to find and see at a glance. But if there are only a few simple elements to navigate through, why do you need a dashboard at all? By getting rid of this interface on the student/parent view, it created a simpler and less cluttered user experience.</p> -->
      <h4 class="centered pt-5">Dashboards should simplify, not complicate.</h4>
      <p>The student overview, curriculum overview, and session overview pages contain a lot of dense information, which can quickly become overwhelming to users. Getting rid of unnecessary labels and extraneous information helped testers complete tasks more quickly.</p>
      <p>While it was tempting to fit as much information as possible onto these screens, the ultimate purpose of a dashboard is to save users time and help them see the most critical data at a glance.</p>
      <h4 class="centered pt-5">Final thoughts.</h4>
      <p>fffr was an incredibly exciting project to work on. Not only does fffr solve common problems faced by private tutors and parents, it's unique Socratic teaching method helps students succeed in a remote-learning format. Learn more at <a href="https://www.hifffr.com">hifffr.com</a>.</p>
