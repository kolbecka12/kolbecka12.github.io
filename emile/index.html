     <h2 class="section-title">The Problem</h2>
     <h4>Both parents and teachers want a more efficient and effective way to both track and ensure student outcomes.</h4>
     <p>Private tutors often find it hard to track their student's progress, with many relying on hand-written notes from the session to remember what was taught. As a result, many struggle to recall exactly what was covered in previous sessions.</p>
     <p class="no-padding">This organizational problem makes it time-consuming to create progress reports for parents, and challenging to ensure that all of their individual students are achieving mastery.</p>

     <p class="no-padding">emile is a mobile app for both busy foodies and people new to seasonal eating, to help them quickly plan a meal or make a shopping list based on what produce is in season in their area.</p>
     <p class="no-padding">Emile is a revolutionary one-on-one remote learning platform that offers student, parent, and tutor views into:</p>

       <li>Independent work assigned and completed</li>
      </ul>
     <p>By giving tutors a system for easily scheduling sessions and tracking progress with individual students, they can better focus their energy on being effective instructors. This data can then help parents monitor whether their child is staying on track without any extra work required from the tutor.</p>

     <h2 class="section-title" id="design-title">Project Background & Design Process</h2>
     <p class="design-process-large">When I joined the Emile team, the CEO and Education Director were looking to pivot the MVP from a university test prep program to a full time, remote secondary school program.</p>
     <p>Emile began as a university test prep business serving students both in-person and online. While they had a long-term plan to expand into full-time remote schooling, the widespread school closures in the US during the coronavirus pandemic inspired them to refocus their initial product offering to serve parents seeking an alternative to remote public school classes.</p>
     <p>A previous designer had done some work on the MVP, including some user interviews, user flows, and wireframes. However, these deliverables were designed for the university test prep program — not full time secondary school. The Emile team was hesitant to toss out the work done by the previous designer, but I had a sense that many features would need to be redesigned.</p>
     <p>I began my design process with a thorough review of the previous research and new program materials. From here, I consulted with key stakeholders to generate a new list of user stories, and redesigned the user flows to better align with the requirements of the full-time school program. These were translated into new wireframes, hifi mockups, interactive prototypes, a style guide, and a final version ready for handoff to the developer.</p>

  <div class="content-box content-box-narrow-desktop">
    <p>Before translating these new user flows into wireframes and hifi mockups, I worked to clarify the branding and style for the Emile desktop and tablet apps. Since I was designing for two very different user groups, I set out to create a palette and design elements that were flexible — brighter colors for kids, and more muted tones for the tutors.</p>
    <img id="palette" src="/images/emile-palette.png" data-aos="fade-up">
    <h4 class="centered">UI Elements</h4>
    <p>Some of the foundational elements, such as alert boxes and buttons, were pulled from the Tailwind UI kit for Figma. Other elements were customized for this project, such as the icons for classes, big ideas, and concepts.</p>

    <img class="display-mobile fill py-5" src="../images/emile-ui-mobile.png" alt="photo collage and color swatches" data-aos="fade-up">
    <h4 class="centered">Typeface</h4>
    <p>Inter UI is a typeface specially designed for user interfaces with a focus on high legibility of small-to-medium sized text on computer screens. I used this typeface for all body and display text in Emile so that tutors and students could focus their energy on the class session, not on deciphering hard-to-read text.</p>

  <div class="content-box content-box-narrow-desktop">
    <p>While the previous designer had created wireframes and low fidelity mockups for a significant number of user flows, these were designed for the university test prep program — not full time secondary school. The Emile team was hesitant to toss out the work done by the previous designer, but I had a sense that many features would need to be redesigned.</p>

    <h4 class="centered pt-5">Rethinking the Session Builder</h4>
    <p>One of the most complex, yet central functions of the Emile app is the Session Builder. Tutors use this tool to assemble class sessions for individual students or groups made up of learning activities, mastery activities (such as in-class quizzes, where students demonstrate competence) and homework assignments.</p>
    <p>Tutors plan out all of the activities for a specific class session <span class="italic">before</span> the class is held, using it as a road map for instruction.</p>
    <p>After the class session, tutors return to the Session Builder to record how students performed in the mastery activities, as well as add or remove any activities that were or weren't covered due to available time.</p>
    <p>When the Session Preview accurately depicts what was covered in a class session, the tutor can Publish the session. Only then is a record of the class session, the student's progress, and associated homework assignments or resources made available for the student and parent to see.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="content-box content-box-narrow-desktop">
    <p>One of the biggest issues with this layout is that users can intentionally or unintentionally exit the flow by clicking on any of these navigation elements.</p>
    <p>The session-building progress typically involved 20 or more screens, and I knew we didn’t want users to navigate away from this flow unless properly warned. There are also so many elements on this screen that it’s difficult for the user to understand what they need to do next.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="prototype-grid wireframe-grid" data-aos="fade-up">
    <img class="shadow-offset justify-center frame-comp" src="../images/mid-fi-session-bldr.png" alt="greyscale wireframe">
    <p class="caption display-mobile paragraph-end">My first new iteration, after reworking the user flows and wireframes.</p>

    <p class="caption" id="test-three-two">Still room for constructive feedback.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="content-box content-box-narrow-desktop">
    <p>My new mid-fi mockups incorporated some pretty major changes.</p>
    <p>In this new version of the Session Builder, all high-level navigation elements were hidden from the user, and next steps were clearly indicated with arrow buttons in the bottom navigation. Users also have clear options to save and exit the flow if they wish, leaving no question as to whether their progress will be saved.</p>
    <p>I also added some simple icons to the class topic hierarchy levels here, as user interviews indicated that people were confused as to how classes, big ideas, and concepts related to one another. My intention was to show these as smaller and smaller elements of a whole.</p>
    <p>When I ran this by the education team, which included some seasoned tutors, they asked if the session preview could show more detail about the different class elements, such as whether homework assignments had been graded yet.  I incorporated this feedback into the final iteration.</p>

  <div class="content-box content-box-narrow-desktop">
    <p>In the final MVP version of the Emile session builder, the session preview window on the right shows which learning, mastery, and homework activities have been added to an upcoming class session. Each section includes detail about which topics and activities will be covered in each category. Tutors have the ability to remove activities, or go back and add more at any point in the flow.</p>

  <div class="content-box content-box-narrow-desktop">
    <h4 class="centered">Don't be afraid to start over when necessary.</h4>
    <p>Had I tried to mold the new FT-school oriented MVP into the designs previously created by the old test-prep oriented MVP, the product would not be as intuitive, there would be more clicks required to find necessary content, and the structure would be quite different. By letting go of attachments to previous work, I could design a better product.</p>
    <h4 class="centered pt-5">Consider whether all users need identical or similarly complex elements.</h4>
    <p>The ultimate function of a dashboard is to make things easier for the user to find and see at a glance. But if there are only a few simple elements to navigate through, why do you need a dashboard at all? By getting rid of this interface on the student / parent view, it created a simpler and less cluttered user experience.</p>
    <p>Emile was an incredibly exciting project to work on. Not only does Emile solve common problems faced by private tutors and parents, it's unique socratic teaching method helps students succeed in a remote-learning format. Learn more at <a href="https://www.hiemile.com">hiemile.com</a>.</p>
