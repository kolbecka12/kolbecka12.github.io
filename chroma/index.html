          <p>The challenge with this project was to imagine how cloud storage could better serve groups with specific needs.</p>
          <p>Rather than create a solution that worked well enough for everybody, I set out to build a product that worked amazingly for digital creatives.</p>

          <p>I kicked off this project with a user survey, to get a sense of how digital creatives were using cloud storage now, as well as what they did and didn’t like about these services. 20 product designers, marketers, social media managers, and graphic artists participated.</p>

        <p>With nearly everyone in the survey group using Google Drive and Dropbox,  I decided to investigate how these major players were succeeding – and where they fell short.

          <p>Keeping the target audience in mind, I knew that including an alternative method of organizing files – something that exists outside of the traditional folder-subfolder hierarchy – would be critical for differentiating our product.</p>
          <p>To address this need, I created user stories that allowed users to add and remove tags from individual files, which could be later be discovered through search.</p>
          <p>Stories for tag creation, the onboarding process, document and folder creation, search functions, file uploading, and account admin tasks were generated. The highest and medium priority tasks were then converted into user flows to show how the user can accomplish the primary tasks.</p>

          <h2 class="section-title">Wireframing</h2>
          <p>Armed with my user flows, I began building out the scaffolding of the app with pen and paper wireframes, and later with Figma. As the app started to take shape, some of the elements described in the user flows were dropped or changed to improve the user experience.</p>
          <p>Originally I had envisioned a combination dashboard, where frequently accessed files and a full view of the file navigation hierarchy would be visible. But I quickly realized that this would be too cluttered, making it difficult to do either task well. I decided to break these out into two separate screens in the digital wireframes, allowing users to toggle back and forth between these views in the left navigation panel.</p>

          <h4 class="centered">Insights from User Testing</h4>
          <p>In general, the participants found the Chroma app to be clear and intuitive to use, but the test also identified some elements which were confusing to users.  Based on this feedback, I had the knowledge to inform some major revisions as I created my first high fidelity prototypes.</p>
          <p class="paragraph-end">In my low fidelity wireframes, the file upload button was nested inside the “+” menu. But two users had difficulty finding this initially. It was moved to the left navigation bar. I also opted to include “drag to center” functionality in the dashboard “empty set” page, to give users another way to upload files quickly.</p>

          <p>Two users also had trouble finding the “add a tag” button here in the left sidebar navigation of my wireframe, but all users intuitively moved to select or hover over the file name when first looking for it. Clearly this was a pattern I needed to include.</p>

          <p>From here, I tested iterations of several site elements using A/B testing with Usability Hub. The design of the tag element, an upload button, and some tiny tweaks to the typeface in the Chroma logo were all tested with users to identify which version was favored.</p>
          <img src="../images/Chroma-tag-style1.png" alt="pink pill button with no x icon">
          <p class="caption">In preference testing, users were evenly split between these two tag styles.</p>
          <p>However, I realized both of these tag input options still had some problems. The tag was first designed for easy dismissal within the document detail view, with a handy “x” allowing you to remove an unwanted tag. But this design bled over into all other screens of the app, showing a tag dismissal option even in places where it didn’t make sense, such as the search screen. </p>
          <p>While the pink version on the left could have provided an alternative for situations when the dismissal “x” wasn’t needed, it lacked visual continuity with the version on the right, which was still needed in some circumstances.</p>
          <p class="paragraph-end">What became clear is that I needed two layouts of this tag for different situations: one with the “x” and one without.</p>

          <p>With this new data, I moved ahead and developed the second iteration of my high fidelity prototype and did another round of user testing. Here you can see my new version of the tag in use, a brighter pill shape with a bit more contrast. The new tag style displays without the dismissal “x” when it isn’t needed — for example, within the “add new tag” menu.</p>

          <h2 class="section-title">Key Learnings</h2>
          <p>Overall, the development of the Chroma app was a really rewarding challenge. I was lucky enough to get some things working well in the first draft, like the homepage layout and onboarding process. I also found that creating a detailed style guide (and updating it as I went through revisions with my visual design) was an enormous help to me as I created each iteration of my high fidelity prototype.</p>
          <p>However, some things that I initially thought would be straightforward – like the tagging concept – required far more planning, testing, and iterating than I had bargained for.</p>
          <p class="paragraph-end">This project has been a great reminder of how important it is to always think about those user profiles during all phases of development, and to continually seek criticism and feedback throughout the design process.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="content-box content-box-narrow-desktop">
          <p>With this final version of Chroma, I’ve created a MVP of a new cloud storage service that solves a major organizational problem faced by creatives.</p>
          <p class="paragraph-end">No longer would designers, marketers, and illustrators be forced to remember that a particular photo was shot and edited on a specific day back in 2017, or recall the particular file name to effectively search for it -- they could just search for any number of tags assigned to the item.</p>
