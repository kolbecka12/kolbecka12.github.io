          <h4>Give the user more control.</h4>
          <p>Chroma was developed to give designers, marketers, and social media managers a better way to organize their files: a customizable tagging system. With user-generated tags, files can be discovered more easily through search, and organization is no longer limited to the traditional file folder system.</p>

        <p>While <strong>Google Drive</strong> offers basic collaboration features and a robust suite of document creation options, it limits users to a traditional file navigation system when it comes to organizing content.</p>
        <p><strong>Dropbox</strong> suffers from this same limitation of folders and sub-folders, and also comes with a slow and clunky desktop navigation interface.</p>
        <p><strong>Notion</strong> does have a tagging feature, allowing you a unique way to search for files you’ve created on the platform. But Notion doesn’t extend this option to other file types, such as images.</p>
        <p>Because a lack of customized organization options was a common weakness shared by all three competitors, I sought to make a tagging system that worked for all file types a key priority for Chroma to better streamline the users’ experience.</p>

        <p>Keeping the target audience in mind, I knew that including an alternative method of organizing files – something that exists outside of the traditional folder-subfolder hierarchy – would be critical for differentiating our product.</p>
        <p>To address this need, I created user stories that allowed users to add and remove tags from individual files, which could be later be discovered through search.</p>
        <p>Stories for tag creation, the onboarding process, document and folder creation, search functions, file uploading, and account admin tasks were generated. The highest and medium priority tasks were then converted into user flows to show how the user can accomplish the primary tasks.</p>

          <p>Armed with my user flows, I began building out the scaffolding of the app with pen and paper wireframes, and later with Figma. As the app started to take shape, some of the elements described in the user flows were dropped or changed to improve the user experience.</p>
          <p>Originally I had envisioned a combination dashboard, where frequently accessed files and a full view of the file navigation hierarchy would be visible. But I quickly realized that this would be too cluttered, making it difficult to do either task well. I decided to break these out into two separate screens in the digital wireframes, allowing users to toggle back and forth between these views in the left navigation panel.</p>

            <h5>Why Chroma?</h5>
            <p>Chroma was chosen as the brand name, as it brings to mind pure, bright pigments — the stuff of artists and creatives everywhere.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-end">The logo was developed to be reminiscent of a compact disc reflecting a prism in the sunlight. While the CD is a largely obsolete memory storage device, it’s still recent enough to be familiar to our target audience of millenials and gen-X’ers.</p>

          <h2 class="section-title">From User Testing to Hi-Fi Prototypes</h2>
          <p>My low fidelity prototypes were linked together into a clickable prototype that illustrated the pathways for 4 user stories: creating an account, creating a new document, uploading a file, and assigning a tag to a file. Three users were tested in person using the desktop version of the app.</p>
          <p>In general, the participants found the Chroma app to be clear and intuitive to use, but the test also identified some elements which were confusing to users.  Based on this feedback, I had the knowledge to inform some major revisions as I created my first high fidelity prototypes.</p>
          <p class="paragraph-end">In my low fidelity wireframes, the file upload button was nested inside the “+” menu. But two users had difficulty finding this initially. It was moved to the left navigation bar. I also opted to include “drag to center” functionality in the dashboard “empty set” page, to give users another way to upload files quickly.</p>

        <article class="content-box">
          <p>Two users also had trouble finding the “add a tag” button here in the left sidebar navigation of my wireframe, but all users intuitively moved to select or hover over the file name when first looking for it. Clearly this was a pattern I needed to include.</p>
          <p class="paragraph-end">In my first high fidelity prototype, I modified the file list view to show the “add a tag” and share button on hover, or when the file is selected in the mobile app.</p>          <p class="caption">“Add a tag” button hidden on the left.

          <h2 class="section-title">Preference Testing</h2>
          <p class="paragraph-end">From here, I tested iterations of several site elements using A/B testing with Usability Hub. The design of the tag element, an upload button, and some tiny tweaks to the typeface in the Chroma logo were all tested with users to identify which version was favored.</p>
          <p class="caption">In preference testing, users were evenly split between these two tag styles.</p>
          <img src="images/Chroma-tag-style1.png">
          <p>However, I realized both of these tag input options still had some problems. The tag was first designed for easy dismissal within the document detail view, with a handy “x” allowing you to remove an unwanted tag. But this design bled over into all other screens of the app, showing a tag dismissal option even in places where it didn’t make sense, such as the search screen. </p>
          <p>While the pink version nn the left could have provided an alternative for situations when the dismissal “x” wasn’t needed, it lacked visual continuity with the version on the right, which was still needed in some circumstances.</p>
          <p class="paragraph-end">What became clear is that I needed two layouts of this tag for different situations: one with the “x” and one without.</p>

          <p class="paragraph-end">For my third and final high fidelity prototype, I spent some time researching common UI patterns for tagging, drawer expansion, and accessible text colors. I wound up making some major changes to the design in this round. Here you can see the Reworked dashboard with higher contrast buttons / search bar, more preview tiles, an “explore your tags” section, and new numbered tag design to account for items with more than three tags.</p>

          <h2 class="section-title">Conclusion</h2>
          <p>Overall, the development of the Chroma app was a really rewarding challenge. I was lucky enough to get some things working well in the first draft, like the homepage layout and onboarding process. I also found that creating a detailed style guide (and updating it as I went through revisions with my visual design) was an enormous help to me as I created each iteration of my high fidelity prototype.</p>
          <p>However, some things that I initially thought would be straightforward – like the tagging concept – required far more planning, testing, and iterating than I had bargained for.</p>
          <p class="paragraph-end">This project has been a great reminder of how important it is to always think about those user profiles during all phases of development, and to continually seek criticism and feedback throughout the design process.</p>

          <p>With this final version of Chroma, I’ve created a MVP of a new cloud storage service that solves a major organizational problem faced by creatives.</p>
          <p class="paragraph-end">No longer would designers, marketers, and illustrators be forced to remember that a particular photo was shot and edited on a specific day back in 2017, or recall the particular file name to effectively search for it -- they could just search for any number of tags assigned to the item.</p>
